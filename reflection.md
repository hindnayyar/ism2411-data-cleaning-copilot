# Reflection

## What Copilot Generated
For this project, I used GitHub Copilot to help me build a few of the functions inside my data_cleaning.py script. I started each function by writing a short comment that described what the function should do, and then Copilot suggested code based on that description. The main places where Copilot generated most of the logic were the `load_data()` function and the `clean_column_names()` function. For example, after I wrote a comment saying that I needed a function to load a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, Copilot automatically suggested code that used `pd.read_csv()` with the file path argument. It also suggested the pattern for cleaning column names by lowering the text, stripping spaces, and replacing spaces with underscores. Copilot made it really quick to get basic structure in place without having to type everything from scratch.

## What I Modified
Even though Copilot gave me a starting point, I still changed several parts of the code to fit what I needed for the assignment. I renamed some of the variables so they matched the style I wanted, and I adjusted part of the cleaning steps to make sure they worked for my specific dataset. For example, Copilot originally suggested using `df.dropna()` for missing values, but I changed it to only drop rows missing price or quantity because that made more sense for this project. I also added more comments before each cleaning step to explain WHY the step matters and not just what it does. Those changes helped me make the script clearer, more organized, and better aligned with the assignment requirements.

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how important it is to clean data before analyzing it. Small issues like messy column names, extra spaces, missing values, or negative quantities can completely break calculations or cause misleading results. I learned how to use pandas to fix problems step by step, and how each cleaning decision affects the final dataset. I also learned how to use GitHub Copilot responsibly. Copilot is helpful for generating starter code, but it is not perfect and always needs human review. I still had to read the suggestions carefully, edit them, and make sure they actually made sense for my specific dataset. This project showed me that AI tools can speed up coding, but I am still the one responsible for the logic, clarity, and quality of the final code.
