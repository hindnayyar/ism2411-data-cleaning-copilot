# ISM2411 Data Cleaning with GitHub Copilot

This project is a mini data-cleaning pipeline created for ISM 2411. The goal of the assignment is to clean a messy sales dataset using Python and pandas, while also demonstrating responsible use of GitHub Copilot. The script loads the raw CSV file, applies several cleaning steps, and outputs a cleaned version of the data.
